I like to think of one MBTI type endearingly anytime I find myself needing to psychoanalytically deconstruct an everyday observation under agricultural society, and that type is the INTP.

These types strike me as blank slates, they are born with an incredible, almost frighteningly robotic immunity to human concerns like personal bias, prejudice, vanity, or ego. They do not show many of the emotional (limbic) reactions people show, such as of hostility, when met with new or confusing ideas, or defensiveness, when reminded of something they feel ashamed or guilty of. INTPs move with impartial grace in a world where people are caught up in their own vain hamster wheels, running by a script of egocentricity, ignorant to abstract, metaphysical reality which they arrogantly dismiss as "unimportant" towards getting by in their hierarchically stratified societies of organised surplus production.

Whenever INTPs confront these demons, people are, in a bout of defensive rage, quick to dismiss their concerns and blame them for all of their shortcomings. "You guys are just toxic", "said like a sore loser", or "you sound like an incel." Worse yet, they get projected onto by the ignorant and reactionary masses, whose see the INTP's equanimity deeply irritating as it scratches at the base of their insecure, vain, and hollow behavioural and cognitive patterns.

However, the truth of the matter couldn't be much more different. INTPs are not inherently "toxic" or "smart" or anything positive or negative for that matter. They are blank slates in the most textbook sense, going about life without needing to scratch a limbic itch - a compulsive need for social validation, a desire to feel powerful, a need to belong within a community, or a need to associate with status symbols or seek prestige. They exist simply, humbly in their graceful elements, secure in their self-contained existence, not needing to bother anybody and equally refusing to let themselves be bothered by others provocation and other egocentric antics.

INTPs, however, impartially absorb into the social qualities of the people around them, adapting to that accord without hiding behind a mask. Where a sadist will learn to fake a broad smile to lure victims or a pervert learn to stand behind the word of God, an INTP who grew up in a society that sadistically exploited them will simply see society for what it is - with no personal stake in the madness. They do not seek to gain from it, in some act of personal redemption for what was done onto them.

They come into this world seeking to harmonise with the flow of life, with the people about them and reality itself. When they are met with hell, it wears them down, implanting seeds of misanthropy, cynicism, and nihilism deep into their well-intentioned minds that only wants to exist peacefully and gracefully.

The hierarchical mind, one that oscillates between bullying and grovelling behind others out of egocentric motives, comes to be well-adjusted to this mad society. It is extrinsically motivated from a deficit of neocortical intelligence, involving facets of abstract thinking and higher-order reasoning, which collectively allow one to independently direct and govern themselves. The egalitarian mind, however, that belongs in another world structured around a culture of mutual respect and tolerance, one where the people cultivate themselves to their own accord without needing to step on others to get what they want, becomes socially ill-adjusted and relatively anti-social.

When INTPs don't find opportunities for growth, learning, and meaning in the midst of a mad society that has untethered itself from humanity's more endearing traits, where the life laid out for them by society feels hollow and pointless to their impartial minds, a life meant only to rouse the vain of heart, the INTP either chooses to maladapt (doing what society has indicated will get them accomodated within the social hierarchy, going to become bullies, cheaters, or confidence artists) or withdraw itself entirely from social discourse (becoming anxious, depressed, demotivated, or involuntarily celibate).

Titles, ranks, fame, and other vanity-appeasing handouts do not rouse the INTP's passions. The thyrogenically energised mind, one necessary to sustain egalitarian thought, is wired for the pursuit of meaning - in nobility, virtue, and a life of aligned purpose, where what they *are*, what they *want*, and what they can *get* rewarded for are in alignment. This is a kind of alignment that exists in nature, like in a hunter-gatherer type society. After all, the INTP's mind is a healthy, energised one, one that nature, if anything, would have and continues to positively select for.

On the contrary, modern agricultural society is a violation of natural law, one where people may obtain what they want through others, through networks of exploitation and collaboration. Mafias, syndicates, cabals, and other networks of collusion are able to get what they want, evading the consequences of their lack of personal competence (and enrichment). A quack can secure a comfortable living by conning others. A charlatan become a famed statesman. As for a hunter, his ability to persuade, convince, and cheat others didn't matter so much as his ability to tackle reality head-on. This check of reality kept such nefarious, unsubstantial characters who dwell primarily in the realm of appearances form proliferating their low-energy (or hypothyroid) genes.

Human brain size was increasing, disease was virtually absent, and there was an almost subtle dance of give-and-take between man and nature. A co-existence within his ecosystem, where he didn't have to cheat his way into survival in some crippled state of health.

Agricultural society is a refuge for undesirables, which protects the clueless and timid while penalising the competent and brave. The year-on-year decrease in adaptive potential in modern humans (an ever-decreasing age of puberty onset, metabolic syndromes, and the like) are essentially consequences of this balancing-act against natural selection. With every generation, the peasants become increasingly reliant on the adrenals for energy, the back-up stress systems so to speak, which they abuse in a desperate bid to survive, paving the way for degenerative disease to set in as the lineage progresses.

While the peasants may foolishly believe that they are at war with the egalitarian mind, who they disparagingly label as heretics, heathens, disbelievers, or witches and look upon with contempt, and whose shining brilliance and esoteric gifts cast a piercing ray of light that cuts right through their hypocrisy and deceit, one must realise they are at war with the fabric of reality itself. Those who dance to nature's rhythms only serve to remind them of what nature itself is trying to show them, which they have shunned out of sight and mind by coddling themselves within a socially constructed, make-believe reality, having now structured their whole lives behind its appearances while using it as a substitute for reality itself.

The blank slate of an egalitarian INTP, healthy in mind and body, then becomes a scapegoat for this disillusioned society's frustrations with itself. 

You only have to take a a good, slow walk outside to grasp that you were never the problem to start with, even if you were told so repeatedly. You will see chaos all around, the neuroticism behind the happy masks, the ill intent behind the empty gestures, and the unhappy marriages behind the grandiose projected by wedding photo albums on Facebook. You will see that you were never the problem and that they can't even stand each other. A society where relationships between man are marked by mistrust and contracts, and where minds are consumed by paranoia leading to an intolerance of ambiguity and the authoritarian culture they have collectively settled upon to soothe that uncertainty. These are dysfunctional humans and it takes a wounded, miserable animal to inflict the kind of cruelty a blank slated personality like the INTP is all too familiar experiencing.
